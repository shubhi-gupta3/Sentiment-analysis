# Sentiment-analysis
### Sentiment analysis using NLTK<br>
In this, I have used sklearn packages and NLTK for removing stopwords and predicting the particular sentiment as positive or negative.<br>
Since this is a classification dataset, I have calculated the accuracy of various machine learning algorithms like Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and logistic regression.
